I'm currently enrolled in full-stack web development boot camp at James McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University.  Having fun learning ALL OF THE THINGS, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, ASP.net, Python, Django, Java, PHP, Laravel, APIs, Node, terminal commands, DOM manipulation, consuming RESTful, parsing JSON, AJAX and the beauty of debugging...  I LOVE how it feels to create with code.  I'm looking forward to using my newfound skills to build fun solutions for my clients!
