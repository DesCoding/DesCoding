Hi!  Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile!  A little about me...  I'm new to coding and am currently enrolled in a full stack web development certification through James McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University. In this program, I'm learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, ASP.net, Python, Django, Java, PHP, Laravel, APIs, Node, terminal commands, DOM manipulation, consuming RESTful, parsing JSON, AJAX and the beauty of debugging...
